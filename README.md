**The Chronotopic Theory of Matter and Time** introduces a novel ontological framework in which time, space, matter, and energy are not fundamental entities, but emergent manifestations of topological tuning across stratified spectral layers of reality. The theory unifies relativistic, quantum, and gravitational phenomena through a single principle of interlayer seepage between nodes of presence.

The core of this ontology is the kernel $K_{AB}(x,x')$, which governs the projection from one layer to another. This kernel is not symbolic or speculative — it is:

Axiomatized with properties like linearity, conservation, causality, and composability.

Parametrizable with a finite set of tunable parameters.

Empirically calibratable using impulse response, spectral analysis, stochastic variance, and numerical inversion.

From the kernel, the theory generates its own physical invariants:

Synchronization velocity $v_{\rm sync}$ from the first moment.

Tuning entropy $\Theta$ from the second moment.

Action quantum $\mathcal{S}_*$ from the kernel’s phase.

These quantities are not postulated — they emerge naturally from the structure of the kernel and are experimentally measurable. Therefore, the theory is not a philosophical overlay on physics, but a generative ontology with predictive and testable power.

$\Psi_B(x) = \int_{\Omega_A} K_{AB}(x,x')\Psi_A(x')d^3x' .$

**Kernel Rhythm Calibration and Cross-Domain Application**

We define a dimensionless kernel rhythm phase for each node (city, delivery point, or service unit) as:

$\Phi_i = \frac{d_i}{L_K}, 
\quad \text{where} \quad 
L_K = \frac{v_{\text{sync}}}{\gamma}.$

Here:

- $d_i$ is the Euclidean distance from the origin or depot [m]
- $v_{\text{sync}}$ is the synchronization velocity [m/s], measured via impulse response, spectral pacing, or fleet-average motion
- $\gamma$ is the decoherence rate [s$^{-1}$], extracted from coherence time, variability, or latency statistics

The phase $\Phi_i$ represents the number of kernel coherence hops from the origin to node $i$.  
Pairwise rhythm similarity is defined as:

$S_{ij} = \exp\!\left(-\frac{|\Phi_i - \Phi_j|}{\Delta \Phi}\right),$

where $\Delta \Phi$ is a tunable sensitivity scale (default: $\Delta \Phi = 1$, corresponding to one coherence hop).
